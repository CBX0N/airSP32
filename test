Over the past three months, I’ve taken time to settle into the role and get up to speed with the team’s ways of working. Adam described the role well from the start, which helped set clear expectations, and I’ve been able to contribute meaningfully while continuing to learn. I’ve appreciated the level of autonomy I’ve been trusted with so far, and I’ve had the chance to contribute to patching cycles and help improve internal processes. The buddy system has worked really well — Sam has gone above and beyond to support me, and if he doesn’t have the answer, he always knows who to point me to. I’m looking forward to building on this momentum as I continue developing in the role.
